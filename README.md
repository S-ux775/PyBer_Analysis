# PyBer_Analysis

** Overview of the analysis:

For a ride-sharing company, analysis will be done on the services they provide by city type and the differences in total fares, average fare per ride and driver and total fare by city type.

** Results:

There are differences in three modes of rides: Urban, Suburban and Rural.
Based on results (PyBer_fare_Summary), we can observe that most profitable business comes from Urban, Suburban and Rural, in descending order.

** Summary:

Service for Urban and Suburban areas should be preferred to rural areas.
